# Advanced React Concepts

This repository is a comprehensive collection of advanced React concepts, complete with definitions, explanations, and demonstrations. It is designed to help developers deepen their understanding of React and apply these concepts in real-world projects.

## Overview

This repository includes:

- Detailed explanations of advanced React concepts
- Demonstrations of these concepts through code examples
- Multiple projects that showcase the practical application of these concepts

## Getting Started

This project uses Vite for fast and efficient development. To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## Advanced React Concepts Covered

- **Portals:** Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
- **forwardRef:** Forwarding refs to access a child component's DOM node or React element
- **Modal Introduction:** Introduction to creating and managing modals in React
- **Modal Walkthrough:** Step-by-step guide to implementing modals in React
- **Error Boundaries:** Handling errors in React components
- **Advanced Key Uses:** Advanced techniques for using keys in React to optimize rendering
- **Capture Event Listeners:** Using capture phase event listeners in React

### Advanced Hooks

1. **useLayoutEffect:** Synchronous version of useEffect, useful for reading layout from the DOM and synchronously re-rendering
2. **useDebugValue:** Custom hook for displaying debug information in React DevTools
3. **useId:** Generates unique IDs for accessibility attributes
4. **useImperativeHandle:** Customizes the instance value that is exposed when using refs
5. **useCallback as ref:** Using useCallback to memoize callback functions

## Projects

This repository includes several projects that demonstrate the application of advanced React concepts:

1. **Date Picker:** A project demonstrating the creation of a date picker component
2. **Infinite Scroll:** A project showcasing the implementation of infinite scrolling in a React application
