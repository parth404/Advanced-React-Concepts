# useId

## Introduction

`useId` is a React hook that generates a unique ID for use in components. This is particularly useful for associating form elements with labels, ensuring that each instance of a component has a unique identifier.

## When to Use

- **Form Elements:** When you need to associate a label with an input element.
- **Accessibility:** When you need to ensure that elements have unique IDs for accessibility purposes.
- **Dynamic Components:** When you have multiple instances of a component and each needs a unique identifier.

## Syntax

```javascript
const id = useId();
```

- id: A unique string that can be used as an identifier.

## Example

```jsx
import React, { useId } from 'react';

function FormComponent() {
  const id = useId();

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor={id}>Name:</label>
      <input id={id} type="text" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default FormComponent;
```

In this example, useId generates a unique ID that is used to associate the label with the input element.

## Benefits

- Uniqueness: Ensures that each component instance has a unique ID.
- Simplicity: Simplifies the process of generating unique IDs without having to manage them manually.
- Accessibility: Helps improve accessibility by ensuring that form elements are properly associated with their labels.
